# About Sundance Radio


Sundance Radio was created to bring people together through music and meaningful programming. Our goal is to provide a platform where creativity, diversity, and community come first.


We believe radio should be more than background noise — it should spark curiosity, encourage conversation, and reflect the people it serves.


## Our Mission


To deliver engaging, inclusive, and independent radio programming that connects listeners and supports creative voices.
